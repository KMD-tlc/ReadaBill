# ReadaBill
Web-based revision of Reading Statutes and Bills publication

The existing (2015) text of the PDF document and a lightly revised version of the same text can be viewed side by side [here](https://kmd-tlc.github.io/ReadaBill/ReadaBill-SXStext.html). Markup and comments can be added to the corresponding printout in the physical folder.

This particular web version follows the pagination in the existing (PDF) document. It doesn't show the section breaks that I'm using for the prettier web version or any other layout changes - these are textual changes only. 

The initial edits are minimal and mostly cosmetic, but I can easily make bigger revisions (such as switching out the examples) if the reviewers so advise.
