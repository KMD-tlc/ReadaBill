Web-based revision of Reading Statutes and Bills publication

The text of this version has been through Policy review. The HTML and CSS, though, should be considered no more than an experiment that I used to try out some presentation ideas - it has NOT been formally reviewed, although a few people have seen it. 

I used Bootstrap 4.1 to save time and because I'm obviously an amateur. Slapping my own stylesheet on top of Bootstrap's is probably not the most gorgeous thing ever, but it seemed like overkill to do anything else (recompile SASS or whatever) for experimental purposes. The somewhat crude multi-page structure might not be to everyone's taste, either. I thought 20+ pages of text was a bit much for a single page. 

Here are some specific things that I know need help. No doubt there are plenty of others.

## p. 1 - *Statutes vs Bills*
The glasses image is a placeholder. A better one would be nice (at least on this page).

## p. 2 - *Statutes: Collection and Organization*
The bookshelf was drawn in Inkscape before I realized that my home version of Illustrator (CS6) wouldn't open it. It's not really finished - couldn't decide if it should be flat or 3D - and it's not positioned very well. It would be cool if it were animated, but would settle for less ugly. I can try to redo it in AI if you want.

## p. 7 - *Parts of a Bill B*
I couldn't figure out how to position the previous / next buttons better on the carousel.

## pp 2-8 - *Statutes C & O* - *How to Read a Bill*
I'm not sure I like all the `<ul>`s / bullet points. They are there because we wanted the hierarchy of the text to be clear, but there may be a better way to do that.
  
## pp 3, 4, 8 - *Parts of a Statute*, *How to Read a Statute*, *How to Read a Bill*
Especially pp 3 & 4 may need more color.

## Overall 
No TLC branding; no accessibility features.
