# ReadaBill
Web-based revision of Reading Statutes and Bills publication

ReadaBill-SXStext.html and ReadaBill-SXS.css are for comparing the existing () text of the PDF document with some suggested revisions.
The two versions can be viewed side by side on this page [+link]. Markup and comments can be added to the corresponding printout (in the folder.

This version follows the pagination in the existing (PDF) document. It doesn't show the section breaks that I'm using for the web version or any other layout changes - these are textual changes only. 

These initial edits are fairly cosmetic, but I can easily make bigger changes (such as switching out the examples) if the reviewers think that would be better.
